# FruitsApp
Encyclopedia of fruits build with new features added to SwiftUI in iOS 14 and 16

## Objectives

- [x] Implement an Onboarding logic, using the property wrapper @AppStorage. The Onboarding logic consists in making a View visible just in the first time the user access the application;
- [x] Create a carousel animation with limited and already known number of sections;
- [x] Fill the View with information coming from a struct to simulate an API call;
- [x] Make a List view implemented, where each item of the list works as a Navigation Link and sends the user to a view with info about the item tapped;
- [x] Build a settings sheet where the user can restart the Onboarding logic and see some info about app development.

## Technologies

- Swift
- SwiftUI
- iOS 16+
